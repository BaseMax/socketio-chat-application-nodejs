## The purpose of this project

We needed to implement a **chat service** in the shortest time. Because **Mehrad Hidden concert** was going to be held soon and the band **RadLive** needed to have this platform without any problems or violations.

Therefore, thousands of people needed to be able to use this chat at the same time.
